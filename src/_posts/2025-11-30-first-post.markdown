Yes, it's true. After many moons, months and years I have _officially_ decided to start curating a blog of mine.

## Context

On 2025-12-01 (Monday), Portugal celebrates the [Restoration of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Restoration_War), a national holiday.

This begat my Blog — but how?

I had chosen this extended weekend to migrate my old and rusty [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) install to a fresh [`archinstall`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Archinstall) with [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/) [^omarchy].

Excluding some minor issues[^lol], that went about pretty fast.

But because I had already set aside time...
And because at least one person (not counting my wife) has told me that I'm bearable enough when speaking about certain topics of my peculiar interest, I decided to start writing.

## Chronogram

1. Attended [Tim Bernardes](https://www.timbernardes.com/) show Saturday night.
2. Learned a bit of [`mise`](https://mise.jdx.dev/) [^mise].
3. Learned a bit of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

And just like that, my blog happened to spawn.

## Future work

As you all know:

> Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift. That is why it is called the present.

- Maybe I'll drop my love for the Em dash.
- Maybe as time goes by this blog will become more work than fun and my happy writing style will gradually become more meaningless technical jargon and more boring.
- Maybe...

## Footnotes

[^omarchy]: Omarchy is great — Yes it's true, there are some of us Arch users who do not enjoy the initial setup process, but then again most of us were probably on Manjaro or other adjacent distros.

[^lol]:
    Two things were annoying:
    First, my motherboard only was not looking in `/boot/EFI/limine/` making me ~~want to cry~~ the unchallenged world record holder for most manual Arch install within 120 minutes.
    Secondly there is a new Bitwarden issue [#17598](https://github.com/bitwarden/clients/issues/17598) that I didn't know about and it ruined my post install experience by driving me crazy for a couple hours.

[^mise]:
    `mise` is turning out to be great — I had been waiting for `PHP` to be added as a [core tool](https://mise.jdx.dev/core-tools.html) to justify the _small_ learning hit.
    `ruby` will suffice.
